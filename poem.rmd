## First Verse

Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well.  
Rest on the friendly knee, intent to ask.  
The tale one loves to tell.   




## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow




## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
